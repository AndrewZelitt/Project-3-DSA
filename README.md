## How to Install our Project

1. Clone the Repository into your chosen IDE
2. Check to See if there are files in the FLTK folder (sometimes the files aren't included from the library)
The link to the repository can be found at [FLTK Library](https://github.com/fltk/fltk/tree/a6651e10ffc1753945faf8de0192cf74effc80d8)
To install the Library, download the zip file from the repository, extract it and copy the files from inside it into the fltk folder in our project.
3. Based on the IDE, the setup to actually run the project will be different.
