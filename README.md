## How to Install our Project

1. Clone the Repository into your chosen IDE
2. Check to See if there are files in the FLTK folder (sometimes the files aren't included from the library)
The link to the repository can be found at [FLTK Library](https://github.com/fltk/fltk/tree/a6651e10ffc1753945faf8de0192cf74effc80d8)
To install the Library, download the zip file from the repository, extract it and copy the files from inside it into the fltk folder in our project.
3. Based on the IDE, the setup to actually run the project will be different.
  ### Visual Studio Code
   1. Clone the repository
   2. Go to the CMake setup tab
   3. Click on the build button and select one of the options at the top of the screen for the compiler
   4. Click build to build the project
   5. Click on the run button when finished and the program should open
  ### Visual Studio
   1. Clone the repository
   2. Go to Project and select "Delete Cache and Reconfigure"
   3. Once that runs, it should say "x64 Debug" or something similar next to a green triangle at the top of the screen, open that dropdown menu and select "x64 Release", and in the drop down to the right of that select "GUI.exe"
   4. Lastly click on the green bordered triangle to the right of the dropdown menu to run the program.
